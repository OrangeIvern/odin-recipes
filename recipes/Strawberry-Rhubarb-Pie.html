		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<p>We love this rhubarb and strawberry pie because it doesn't call for a ton of hard-to-find ingredients. Here's what you'll need to add to your grocery list:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Flour: All-purpose flour will combine with the juices from the rhubarb and strawberries to create a thick filling.</li>
			<li>Rhubarb: Thoroughly clean your rhubarb stalks, then slice them into ¼-inch pieces.</li>
			<li>Strawberries: Hull and quarter about two pints of strawberries. In a pinch, frozen berries will work — but fresh is best for this recipe.</li>
			<li>Pie crust: Use a store-bought double pie crust or try our top-rated Butter Flaky Crust.</li>
			<li>Butter: Adding a little bit of fat to the filling will keep the juices from bubbling over.</li>
			<li>Egg yolk: Brush the finished pie crust with an egg yolk to add color and shine.</li>			
		</ul>

		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Make the filling; Mix the flour and sugar in a large bowl. Add the rhubarb and strawberries, then toss until the fruit is fully coated. Let the mixture stand for about half an hour.</li>
			<li>Fill the pie: Pour the filling into a pie crust, dot with butter, and add the top layer. Crimp edges with wet fingers to seal. Brush the top layer with the egg yolk and cut small holes to allow the steam to escape.</li>
			<li>Bake the pie: Bake the pie in a preheated oven until the filling is bubbly and the crust is golden brown. Let the pie cool on a wire rack before cutting and serving.</li>	
		</ol>
